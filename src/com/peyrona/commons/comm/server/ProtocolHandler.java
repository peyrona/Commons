/**
 * This class is a base implementation that is used by TCPServerXXX:
 * it creates and runs instances of subclasses of this class inside a thread.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are created and run at the server side, therefore
 * each time an exception is thrown, the client socket should be closed because
 * it is unstable and most probably it will be imposible to be used from this
 * moment. This is not a problem: a new connection will be requested at the
 * client side, accepted at the server side and aa new protocol instance created.
 * <p>
 * Note: even if this implementation is thread safe (it is inmutable), it is not
 * needed to be thread safe, because a new instance is created each time by the
 * Server Socket.
