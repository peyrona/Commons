# Peyrona Commons
This is my equivalent to the Apache-Commons.

In my spare time I write Java code for embedded devices: this code must be as small as possible (low RAM footprint).
This is the reason I can not use all the libs I'd like to use.

Sinve early 2000 (this millenium) I've beeing creating this lib by adding the functions I needed.

It is 97% documented in English and test coverage is around 95%.

If you find it useful, go ahead with it.
